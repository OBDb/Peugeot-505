    description: "The Peugeot 505 was introduced as a replacement for the successful 504, designed by Pininfarina with clean, elegant lines that would age remarkably well throughout its long production run. Available primarily as a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon (the latter available with rear-facing third-row seats in some markets), with some markets also receiving coupe and pickup variants. The rear-wheel drive platform featured a sophisticated suspension system with MacPherson struts up front and semi-trailing arms at the rear, delivering the exceptional ride comfort and handling balance for which Peugeot was renowned. Powertrain options evolved substantially throughout production, initially including gasoline engines from 1.8L to 2.2L and diesel options from 2.3L to 2.5L. Later models received fuel injection, turbocharging (both gasoline and diesel), and more powerful variants including the sporty 505 Turbo featuring a 2.2L turbocharged engine producing up to 180 horsepower. Transmission options included 4 and 5-speed manuals and a 3-speed automatic. The interior emphasized comfort with supportive seats designed for long-distance travel, logical control layout, and surprisingly spacious accommodations for both passengers and cargo, particularly in the wagon variant. The model received several updates throughout its production, with the most significant refresh in 1986 bringing revised styling, improved interior, and updated powertrains. The 505 became one of Peugeot's most globally successful models, appreciated for its durability, comfort, and capability, with particular success in Africa, South America, and Australia where its rugged construction and refined ride quality were especially valued. In North America, it represented Peugeot's flagship until the brand's withdrawal from the market in 1991. By the end of its production, over 1.3 million units had been sold globally, making it one of Peugeot's most significant models of the era."
